# GCodeWithPOVRay
A tool for fancy visualization of 3D printing GCdoes with [POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/download/).

## Main idea
Provided an input 3D printing GCdoe file by the user, this tool generates a POV-Ray rendering file containing smooth geometries imitating the pushing filament along the printing paths in the GCdoe.

Then the user could render the prints by loading the rendering file with POV-Ray.

An example is illustrated below:
