# GCodeWithPOVRay
A tool for fancy visualization of 3D printing GCdoes with [POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/download/).

## Main idea
Provided an input 3D printing GCdoe file by the user, this tool generates a POV-Ray rendering file containing smooth geometries imitating the pushing filament along the printing paths in the GCdoe.
